-For this project, it is recommended that you use the VMBox virtual environment provided with the Course package and the tools therein. You may also use your own system and software, however make sure that appropriate versions are installed. The answers are compatible with the following versions of the software: **samtools v.1.2, bowtie v.2.2.5 and bcftools v.1.2**. 

-As part of the effort to catalog genetic variation in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, you re-sequenced the genome of one strain (**‘wu_0_A’; genome file: ‘wu_0.v7.fas’**), to determine genetic variants in this organism. **The sequencing reads** produced are in the file **‘wu_0_A_wgs.fastq’**. Using the tools bowtie2, samtools and bcftools, develop a pipeline for variant calling in this genome. 

-NOTE: Genome and re-sequencing data have been obtained and modified from those generated by the 1001 Genomes Project, accession ‘Wu_0_A’. 

Apply to questions 1 - 5: 
Generate a bowtie2 index of the wu_0_A genome using bowtie2-build, with the prefix 'wu_0'. 

Apply to questions 6 - 14: 
Run bowtie2 to align the reads to the genome, under two scenarios: first, to report only full-length matches of the reads; and second, to allow partial (local) matches. All other parameters are as set by default. 

**For the following set of questions (11 - 20)**, use the set of full-length alignments calculated under scenario 1 only. Convert this SAM file to BAM, then sort the resulting BAM file. 

Apply to questions 15 - 19: 
Compile candidate sites of variation using SAMtools mpileup for further evaluation with BCFtools. Provide the reference fasta genome and use the option “-uv” to generate the output in uncompressed VCF format for easy examination. 

Apply to questions 20 - 24: 
Call variants using ‘BCFtools call’ with the multiallelic-caller model. For this, you will need to first re-run SAMtools mpileup with the BCF output format option (‘-g’) to generate the set of candidate sites to be evaluated by BCFtools. In the output to BCFtools, select to show only the variant sites, in uncompressed VCF format for easy examination.

### 1. How many sequences were in the genome?
```{bash}
grep –c “^>” wu_0.v7.fas

\#\# 7

### 2. What was the name of the third sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the “>” sign.
```{bash}
grep “^>” wu_0.v7.fas | head -3 
```
\#\# Chr3

### 3. What was the name of the last sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the “>” sign.
```{bash}
grep “^>” wu_0.v7.fas | tail -1

```{bash}
cat wu_0_A_wgs.fastq | wc -l
```
\#\# 147354

### 7. How many matches (alignments) were reported for the original (full-match) setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
### 9. How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 7?
### 11. How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 7? You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.
```{bash}
bowtie2 -p 4 -x wu_0/wu_0 wu_0_A_wgs.fastq -S wu_0.bt2.sam
```
147354 reads; of these:  
  147354 (100.00%) were unpaired; of these:  
    9636 (6.54%) aligned 0 times  
    93780 (63.64%) aligned exactly 1 time  
    43938 (29.82%) aligned >1 times  
93.46% overall alignment rate

### 8. How many matches (alignments) were reported with the local-match setting? Exclude lines in the file containing unmapped reads.
### 10. How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 8?
### 12. How many reads had multiple matches in the scenario in Question 8? Use the format above. You can find this in the bowtie2 summary; note that by default bowtie2 only reports the best match for each read.
