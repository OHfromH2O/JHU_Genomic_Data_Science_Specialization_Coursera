    "-In a practical, we saw the scs function (copied below along with overlap) for finding the shortest common superstring of a set of strings.<br>\n",
    "-It's possible for there to be multiple different shortest common superstrings for the same set of input strings. Consider the input strings ABC, BCA, CAB. One shortest common superstring is ABCAB but another is BCABC and another is CABCA.\n",

    "###Question 1)\n",
    "What is the length of the shortest common superstring of the following strings?<br>\n",
    ": CCT, CTT, TGC, TGG, GAT, ATT\n",
    "\n",
    "###Question 2) \n",
    "How many different shortest common superstrings are there for the input strings given in the previous question?<br>\n",
    "-Hint 1: You can modify the scs function to keep track of this. "
