>This Specialization covers **the concepts and tools** to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next generation sequencing experiments. It teaches the most common tools used in genomic data science including how to use **the command line**, along with a variety of software implementation tools like **Python, R, and Bioconductor**. 


>**Skills** that the Specilization deals with:
**Bioinformatics, Statistics, Data Science, Computational Biology, Biopython, Python Programming, Genomics, Bioinformatics Algorithms, Algorithms, Algorithms On Strings, Samtools, Unix.**


>The Specialization included eight courses. 
>However, two courses (Galaxy and Capstone) had been closed since the 5th of November, 2021. 
>As a result, the specialization now covers six courses.

**1. Introduction to Genomic Technology**
- introduce to the basic biology of modern genomics and the experiment tools
- cover how next-generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. 
- understand how data from next-generation sequencing experiments are generated and analyzed

**2. Python for Genomic Data Science**
- introduce to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook

**3. Algorithms for DNA Sequencing**
- learn computational methods, such as algorithms and data structures, for analyzing DNA sequencing data
- use Python to implement key algorithms, and analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets

**4. Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science**
